	<h1><strong> A brief summary of Breaking Bad</strong></h1>
	<p>Breaking Bad follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Desperate to leave money for his family, he partners with former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce and sell high-quality meth.

As Walter adopts the alias "Heisenberg," he becomes increasingly ruthless, navigating the dangerous drug trade—battling rival dealers, cartels, and the law. His lies and violent actions strain his relationships with his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and brother-in-law DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), who unknowingly investigates Heisenberg’s empire.

Over five seasons, Walter’s ambition and ego drive him deeper into darkness, leading to betrayals, tragic deaths, and irreversible consequences. The series culminates in a dramatic finale where Walter faces the fallout of his choices.
